add logfile to handle error log especially for crc

check if when i write in /etc/modules i need a reboot or not and adapt the script 
configure.sh that seem with need to reboot because the kernel load module in 
/etc/modules at the boot

write the code in main to use multiple sensor or not
with config.txt file ( many_sensor at 0 or 1 )
after this put an another sensor on the same 1 wire and test it

test class to send query in c++ and add it to the main class(create one)

change the path to conf.txt in absolute path to /etc/default at the end of the project
