add logfile to handle error log especially for crc

write the code in main to use multiple sensor or not
with config.txt file ( many_sensor at 0 or 1 )
after this put an another sensor on the same 1 wire and test it
how we know which sensor is in which room ?

change the path to conf.txt in absolute path to /etc/default at
the end of the project
we also need to setup the variable in config.txt so we need the permission
and know where is the file

Put the program in /usr/local/bin
