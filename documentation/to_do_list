add logfile to handle error log especially for crc

read 'How linux works' book for the compilation and handling source part,
see also make and thing about init.d, /etc/default ... P329+
see also the pdf on my tablet about debian adminitration

write the code in main to use multiple sensor or not
with config.txt file ( many_sensor at 0 or 1 )
after this put an another sensor on the same 1 wire and test it
how we know which sensor is in which room ?

test class to send query in c++ and add it to the main class(create one)


change the path to conf.txt in absolute path to /etc/default at
the end of the project
we also need to setup the variable in config.txt so we need the permission
and know where is the file

correct the error in ds18b20.cpp in read_temp_raw when we use the while with
getline it modify sensor_file variable try to find why and correct it

delete close_sensor() in ds18b20.cpp
